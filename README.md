# Simon Game

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon game. The game tests the player's memory by displaying a sequence of colors that the player must repeat in the correct order. As the player successfully completes each sequence, the game adds another color to the sequence and the level increases.

## Description

The Simon game is a simple yet challenging memory game. Players must watch the sequence of colors displayed by the game and repeat the sequence by clicking on the corresponding colored boxes. The game starts with a single color and adds an additional color to the sequence with each level. The game continues until the player makes a mistake by clicking on the wrong color.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The game is designed to be played on various screen sizes.
- **Interactive UI**: The colored boxes flash to indicate the sequence, providing visual feedback to the player.
- **Dynamic Levels**: The game dynamically increases the difficulty by adding more colors to the sequence as the player progresses.
- **Game Over Indication**: When the player makes a mistake, the background flashes red and displays a game over message with the player's score.
- **Restart Functionality**: Players can restart the game by pressing any key after a game over.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Press any key to start the game.
2. **Watch the Sequence**: Observe the color sequence displayed by the game.
3. **Repeat the Sequence**: Click on the colored boxes in the same order as the sequence.
4. **Advance Levels**: Successfully repeat the sequence to advance to the next level, where an additional color will be added.
5. **Game Over**: The game ends when the player clicks on the wrong color. The score is displayed, and the player can restart by pressing any key.
